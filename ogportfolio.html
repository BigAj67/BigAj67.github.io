        <!--this is a good description of me-->
        <p>All about me,Ever since the day I was born I've been swinging a bat and I'm still 
            doing that till this day. I was born and raised in Albany Park,Chicago with my mom
            and my grandparents. I attended Harriet Tubman elementary school from kindergarden 
            until 8th grade but I now attend Lane Tech High School. I've always been a really
            big sports guy but baseball just feels like more than a sport but a huge part of 
            my life. I do play football and I used to play basketball, for football I play 
            quarteback and for basketball I play shooting guard but I kind of quit basketball 
            just to focus on baseball.I'm just a regular person with a big <b>dream</b>.
            I don't see myself in special in anyway or as someone that desrves more than other people. 
            I do believe that if you work hard enough then you will successed. So hopefully in a few
            years I'm in college and being succesesfull is a thing that I am.<br> 
            I am also a big family guy, there is nothing that I love more in my life than my family.
            wether it's mom,dad,grandparents,or best friends it is very hard for me to lose love for 
            them. They are the only constant in my life and I am beyond greatful for that and they 
            help me through every step of my life. another thing that I like to do in my life 
            is vacation I go on a lot of trips with my family even if its a close weekend trip 
            or a month long vacation but I love it. getting to spend time in a place outside of home
            with the people that you love is such a fun thing to do and I do miss my friends 
            most of the time but it's worth the family time. So to round things out I'm just 
            an athlete that loves his family and likes to adventure.
